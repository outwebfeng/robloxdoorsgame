            <h2 style="color: white;text-align: left;">How Roblox Doors Came to Be</h2>
            <p>The development of Roblox Doors was inspired by popular horror games that challenge players with exploration, puzzles, and the thrill of unpredictable enemies. LSPLASH wanted to create a game that wasn't just about jump scares, but also required players to think, strategize, and adapt. With the vision of a haunted hotel filled with randomly generated rooms, LSPLASH set out to create a game that keeps players on edge, not knowing what lies beyond each door.</p>
            <p>Creating the mechanics for Roblox Doors involved months of planning and testing. The team designed a unique randomization system to ensure that each room layout, puzzle, and monster encounter varied from game to game. This randomness adds replayability and ensures that players never get too comfortable. Each monster, like Rush, Seek, and Ambush, has unique mechanics and patterns, forcing players to learn different survival strategies.</p>
            <p>A significant aspect of Roblox Doors' success is its immersive horror aesthetic. From dimly lit corridors to unsettling sound effects, the game's atmosphere intensifies the player experience. LSPLASH incorporated chilling visuals, sound cues, and music to heighten suspense, making the game an authentic horror experience within the Roblox platform, which is typically known for family-friendly games. This dark and thrilling approach has helped Roblox Doors carve out a unique space in the platform.</p>

            <h2>Roblox Doors Pro Tips: Elevate Your Roblox Doors Beats</h2>
            <ul class="tip-list">
                <li><strong>Learn the Sound Cues:</strong> Audio cues are crucial in Roblox Doors, as each monster has unique sounds that signal its approach. Pay close attention to flickering lights (Rush) and Seek's eerie background music. Wearing headphones can heighten your awareness and help you dodge incoming threats more efficiently.</li>
                <li><strong>Use Hiding Spots Sparingly:</strong> Closets and hiding spots can save you from monsters like Rush and Ambush, but avoid over-relying on them. Ambush, for example, can return multiple times, so it's better to exit and re-enter your hiding spot to stay safe. Learning when to hide and when to run is key to surviving the deeper levels.</li>
                <li><strong>Be Prepared for Ambush's Multiple Attacks:</strong> Ambush is one of the most challenging creatures, as it can return multiple times. When Ambush approaches, hide and be ready to exit and re-enter your spot if needed. Listen carefully for sound cues to know when it's safe to leave.</li>
